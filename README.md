# FFMPEG-friendly
A couple of simple scripts that concatenate and/or trim video files using FFMPEG.
Select the video(s) file(s) and follow the instructions shown in the terminal and file dialogs.
### These scripts does not re-encode the file, so certain ingesting service may not be able to handle these files.

This script were made as part of my job at an audiovisual producer, but it's free to use for everyone.
